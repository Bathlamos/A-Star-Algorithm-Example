# A* Algorithm Example
The purpose of this repository is to experiment with an informed search
algorithm, which will include a representation of the world, an algorithm for search, and
the observation of some metrics associated with the search algorithms you are using.

We consider a maze in which each smiley face indicates a possible starting
position, and the middle square containing a house represents the goal position. The
squares containing black blocks represent obstacles that cannot be crossed by a smiley
face. Smiley faces cannot go outside of the bounds of the maze either.
The smiley faces are allowed to move in 4 directions: up, down, left and right, as long as
no obstacle blocks their way. They can only move by one square at a time.
